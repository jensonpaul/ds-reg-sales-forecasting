# Machine Learning for Sales Forecasting


Walmart has been having trouble figuring out how much to buy to restock its products and optimize sales. On the last important dates for the retail sector, the team had problems with purchasing supplies. In some departments, the purchase was above the expected sales and in others there was a lack of products.

The supply team asked us to help them solve their problem in forecasting demand for each store and each department. The team opted to build a regression model to predict sales and thus help the supply team scale purchases.
